# /perma-list — see what's registered

A quick read-only index of every Permanence stream, mainly so a project **name** can be
found before it's used with `/perma-startup <name>` or `/perma-shutdown <name>` — those
commands need an exact match, and this is how you get one instead of guessing.

## How to run it

1. **Discover the streams**, the same way `/perma-consolidate` does: every `~/permanence/<...>/`
   directory containing a `PROJECT.md`, plus the root `perma-meta`. New streams show up
   automatically — don't rely on a stale list from memory.
2. **For each stream**, gather:
   - The stream name (its path relative to `~/permanence`).
   - A one-line "what it is", read from `PROJECT.md`'s opening description.
   - Its `Last updated` date from `PROJECT.md`'s header.
   - Its registered real-world path, if any — check `~/permanence/_meta/REGISTRY.md` (or run
     `~/permanence/runtime/resolve-path.sh <stream>`; a stream can have zero, one, or more
     rows). No path is a normal outcome (a topic-only project), not an error.
3. **Mark the active stream, if there is one.** If a stream is currently the active stream
   for this conversation (set by an earlier `/perma-startup` or `/perma-register` call this
   session), mark it plainly — e.g. a leading `→` — so it's obvious at a glance which one
   the conversation is currently in.
4. **List them**, most-recently-updated first, one line each: name, the active marker if
   any, the one-line description, the path (or "no registered path").

## Guardrails

- **Read-only.** Never writes anything to Permanence — same class as `/perma-brief`.
- **Don't editorialise.** Just the facts pulled from each stream's own `PROJECT.md`/registry
  row — no opinions on which project to work on next (that's `/perma-startup`'s job, scoped
  to one stream).

If `~/permanence` is missing, say so plainly rather than inventing content.
