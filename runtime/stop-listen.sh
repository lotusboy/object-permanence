# stop-listen.sh — Stop hook. When a Claude finishes a turn and would go idle, surface any NEW Permanence
# events addressed to THIS session's stream that arrived DURING the turn, and block the stop so the
# model reads/acts on them instead of falling idle unaware. The twin of events-listen.sh (which
# fires on the next user prompt): together they close the gap where a sibling's message lands mid-turn.
#
# Cost: a pure local file read — costs a model turn ONLY when there's genuinely a new message.
# Shares the per-stream cursor with events-listen.sh, so each message is delivered exactly once
# across both hooks.
#
# Loop-safety: a Stop hook receives a JSON object on stdin (incl. `stop_hook_active`) and may print
# {"decision":"block","reason":...} to keep the turn going. We NEVER block when stop_hook_active is
# true, and we advance the cursor whenever we surface — so the same message can never re-block.
# One-way flow: events reach context only, never the repo files.
